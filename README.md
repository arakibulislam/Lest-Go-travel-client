# About My Project
Since tourism is one of the most significant industries in Bangladesh, we aim to simplify it with our project, helping people to spend a holiday at some of the most desirable holiday destinations. With this site, we aim to handle the planning part while families can just focus of the fun part.

I am using Reactjs for the front-end and Mongodb/heroku for the back-end. The styling part will be done using CSS and BootStrap while the functionality will be added using JavaScript. We plan on making it as user-friendly as possible, with preplanned packages and even custom packages available which user can choose according to his preference.
